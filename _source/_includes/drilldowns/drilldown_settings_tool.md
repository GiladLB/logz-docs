To expand the scope of your search from one data source interface to another, create a drilldown: Each drilldown creates a link between data entities in Logz.io observability products, where the link is already filtered by the selected field.

You can create a library of reusable drilldown templates for cross platform observability, apply them to your unique data, and then share the drilldowns for better collaboration and analysis.
