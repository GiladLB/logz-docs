## PostgreSQL

This dashboard provides an interface to view and analyze metrics from your PostgreSQL databases.

| Cache Hit Rate | Number of times disk blocks were found already in the buffer cache, so that a read was not necessary (this only includes hits in the PostgreSQL buffer cache, not the operating system's file system cache) divided by the sum of number of times disk blocks were found already in the buffer cache, so that a read was not necessary (this only includes hits in the PostgreSQL buffer cache, not the operating system's file system cache) and the number of disk blocks read in this database. |
